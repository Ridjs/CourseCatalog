The objectives of this course are to develop a basic understanding of the significant theories, concepts, and issues in the field of psychology; apply theoretical concepts in psychology to everyday situations in order to help you better understand yourself and the world around you, and develop an understanding of the scientific method in psychological research.  This course is intended for qualified and motivated students who wish to complete studies equivalent to a college level introductory psychology course.  It is significantly more rigorous and difficult than Psychology (H12034).     A college level text is used so students must possess both above average reading comprehension and the ability to read independently to complete requirements. Due to the pace of the course, students must possess organizational and time management skills with the expectation that students will be able to keep up with the pacing of a college level course independently.   Other topics include sensation, perception, biological bases of behavior, learning, intelligence, cognition, development (prenatal to adulthood), personality, group influence and abnormal behavior. This course includes the presentation of videos and discussion of mature content as outlined in College Board. There will be a summer assignment which includes reading the first two chapters of the textbook and completion of a project based on that material.
